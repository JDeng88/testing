Question 1
The intrapage link scrolls to a different part of the page.
Since I set the href of the intrapage tag to an css id, the link scrolls to the heading with that id.

Question 2
I chose an unordered list for this section.
There is no inherent order for skills, and they were all self explanatory, making an unordered the logical choice.
